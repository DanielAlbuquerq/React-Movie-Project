# React-Movie-Project

Basic application using API data from omdbapi.com, some react hooks, and css properties for a fully mobile responsive page.   To make our project Dynamically we used two useState Hooks one to store all movies to populate them and the second hook inside the input to dynamically change the  value by target.value and We used The map()  method to map over all movies and set the props to each movie into the array.
